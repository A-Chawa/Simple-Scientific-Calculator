## Getting Started

There is no need to install any packages, as you only need the built in modules 'math' and 'tkinter'

### Prerequisites

On the module level, the 'math' and 'tkinter' module is already imported and included in the code.

```
import Tkinter as tk
from math import *
```

### Installing

Download any Python 3 IDE and run the code, or you can clone/download it from the homepage of the project.

## Deployment

Run the code

## Built With

* [Python 3](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - The IDE used
* [Tkinter Module](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/tkinter.html) - GUI and styling
* [Math Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) - Functions

## Contributing

Message me about any suggestions or ways to make the code more efficient and I'd be happy to listen.
