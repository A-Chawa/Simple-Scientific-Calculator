# Scientific Calculator

This is a basic, semi-minimalist scientific calculator that has a number of essential functions used in science and math classes. 

## Getting Started

There is no need to install any packages, as you only need the built in modules 'math' and 'tkinter'

### Prerequisites

On the module level, the 'math' and 'tkinter' module is already imported and included in the code.

```
import Tkinter as tk
from math import *
```

### Installing

Download any Python 3 IDE and run the code, or you can clone/download it from the homepage of the project.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

### Break down into end to end tests

### And coding style tests

## Deployment

Run the code
